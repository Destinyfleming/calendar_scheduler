# calendar_scheduler
In this project I created a basic work day schedule where users could input different events and the site would save them to local storage as well as some other functionalities like the time block color changing depending on the time of day and display todays date. 

I used a lot of Jquery and some CSS and HTML.

I also linked the hosted webpage here:
[a link] ( https://destinyfleming.github.io/calendar_scheduler/)

and there is a screenshot in the assets folder.
